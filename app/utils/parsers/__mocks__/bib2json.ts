        abstract:
          'To show the relationship between the nozzles and the powder flows, computational fluid dynamics and discrete element methods were used to simulate the interactions between the powder particles and the gas flows. Experiment was carried out for the validations. Then, laser irradiation rate (LIR) and powder aggregation degree (PAD) were defined to evaluate the influences of the nozzle geometries on the powder flow behaviors in DED. Results indicate that the divergence angle of the powder stream can be obviously affected by the changes of nozzles. The divergence angle can be increased from 15Â° with three-jet nozzle to 17Â° with four-jet nozzle. But at the same work conditions, the divergence angle with annular nozzles is only 8Â°. The powder mass concentration (PMC), LIR and PAD can be further used for the determination of the stand-off distance in DED. The determined stand-off distance of the annular coaxial nozzle is larger than the three-jet and four-jet nozzles. The PMC is increased by 66.7% in DED with annular coaxial nozzle in comparison with the three-jet and four-jet nozzles. The defined parameters of PMC, LIR and PAD can be used for the systematic determination of stand-off distance for better controlling of DED. Â© 2022 The Society of Powder Technology Japan',

        abstract:
          'The final mechanical and physical properties should be predicted in tandem with the bead geometry characteristics for effective additive manufacturing (AM) solutions for processes such as directed energy deposition. Experimental approaches to investigate the final geometry and the mechanical properties are costly, and simulation solutions are time-consuming. Alternative artificial intelligent (AI) systems are explored as they are a powerful approach to predict such properties. In the present study, the geometrical properties as well as the mechanical properties (residual stress and hardness) for single bead clads are investigated. Experimental data is used to calibrate multi-physics finite element models, and both data sets are used to seed the AI models. The adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and a feed-forward back-propagation artificial neural network (ANN) system are utilized to explore their effectiveness in the 1D (discrete values), 2D (bead cross-sections), and 3D (complete bead) domains. The prediction results are evaluated using the mean relative error measure. The ANFIS predictions are more precise than those from the ANN for the 1D and 2D domains, but the ANN had less error for the 3D scenario. These models are capable of predicting the geometrical and the mechanical properties values very well, including capturing the mechanical properties in transient regions; however, this research should be extended for multi-bead scenarios before a conclusive âbest approachâ strategy can be determined.

        abstract:
          "Additive manufacturing (AM) is a powerful and promising manufacturing technology. Advances in AM have led to increasing demands for its applications; however, controlling the geometry of deposited objects during the AM process remains a major challenge. Geometry control and compliance to a target geometry are some of the key concerns for AM, especially for a prototype requiring high precision in its geometry. In this study, an online geometry estimation methodology for continuous monitoring during the directed energy deposition (DED) process was developed using a laser line scanner. Our proposed methodology comprises (1) real-time scanning of each deposited track's profile, (2) online extraction of the track's geometry, and (3) online plotting and comparison of the as-designed and as-built models. In the methodology, data analysis following real-time scanning, such as geometry discrepancy estimation and online plotting of the as-built model, is attained for both single- and multi-layer objects. The effectiveness of our developed methodology is examined by comparing the profiles of the single- and multi-layer objects estimated during the DED process with the reference profiles obtained via laser line scanning and microscopy after the completion of the DED process.

        abstract:
          "One of today's ongoing challenges in directed energy deposition (DED) is controlling the geometry and material properties of parts. This manufacturing process is complex and nonlinear due to multiple physical phenomena at play and is therefore hard to model analytically. Machine learning (ML) on the contrary is particularly well suited to predict the behavior of a complex process with multiple inputs and outputs such as DED. A significant amount of data is required to train machine learning models, but experimental data are costly time-wise and should therefore be produced in an intelligent way. As a stepping stone for the future production of experimental training data, a finite element model of the process was developed in this study as an unlimited source of training data for the ML models. This model takes into account the printing parameters (laser speed, laser power, and powder flow rate) and outputs' simulated process monitoring data thanks to a postprocessing method that is outlined in this article. A dataset was produced by simulating 102 tracks in 316L stainless steel with the model. From the analysis of this dataset, it was shown that K-nearest neighbors, support vector regression, decision tree regression, linear regression, and artificial neural network models are all capable of modelling the relationship between the printing parameters and the melt pool characteristics effectively.

        abstract:
          'Directed energy deposition (DED) is a widespread laser additive manufacturing process characterized by the simultaneous laser and powder delivery. During the layerwise bounding of the material, many complex interconnected physical phenomena take place in a very short time. Presently, one of the main challenges faced by DED is to enhance the powder deposition efficiency. It is defined as the ratio of powder that has been effectively solidified in the part over the total amount of powder that flowed through the nozzle while the laser was on during the deposition process. Increasing the powder efficiency would allow us to minimize the powder waste, minimize the overall costs of the DED process, and therefore reduce the printed part cost. The present work, therefore, proposes to study the influence of laser beam diameter, stand-off distance, and gas/powder settings on the DED powder efficiency. The considered gas/powder settings are carrier and shielding gas volumetric flow rate, powder mass flow rate, and particle diameter. The efficiency is computed by means of the geometry of 316L stainless steel single-track deposits. The track geometries are evaluated based on the deposition width, deposition height, and area of deposition, all extracted from the deposition profiles measured by means of laser triangulation. Optical micrographs of the single-track transversal cross sections are linked to the obtained powder efficiencies. The final aim is to get insight into the effect of process parameters on the powder efficiency and print quality and to identify the optimal process parameter combination in order to maximize the powder efficiency.

        abstract:
          'This research focuses on specimen geometry and the associated surface roughness of H13 hot-work tool steel, processed using laser-directed energy deposition additive manufacturing, and varying both the powder feed rate and the laser scanning speed. Under the examined conditions, the test sample measurements of length and width did not vary, but the sample heights were significantly affected by the scanning speed. An increase in scan speed resulted in âunderbuildingâ, while a decrease resulted in âoverbuildingâ, as might be anticipated. The top surface roughness of the samples was found to be greater than the side surface roughness, due to the capture of extra powder particles. For the single-track and multitrack clad samples, the surface roughness was increased when decreasing the scan speed. The addition of a draft angle, when producing 3-D components, was shown to reduce the side surface roughness. Using a finer layer thickness results in overbuilding the target height, while a coarser layer thickness results in underbuilding. Finally, the surface roughness exhibited no clear trend when the layer thickness was changed.

        abstract:
          'Laser-based Directed Energy Deposition (DED-LB) represents a production method of growing importance for cladding and additive manufacturing through the use of metal powders. Yet, most studies utilize substrate materials with thicknesses of multiple millimeters, for which laser cladding of thin-sheet substrates with thicknesses less than 1 mm have only been scarcely studied in the literature. Most studies cover the use of pulsed laser sources, since sheet distortion due to excess energy input is a key problem in laser cladding of thin-sheet substrates. Hence, the authors of the present investigation seek to expand the boundaries of cladding thin-sheet substrates through the use of a high-speed laser cladding approach which utilizes a continuous-wave, ytterbium fiber laser and traverse speeds of 90 mm sâ1 to clad stainless steel sheets with a thickness of 0.8 mm. Furthermore, fundamental processâproperty relationships for the target values of clad width, clad height, and dilution depth are studied and thoroughly discussed. Additionally, process maps for the target values are established based on manifold experiments, and the significance of process parameters on target values is studied using analysis of variance. The results demonstrate that clad widths as high as 1413 Âµm and dilution depths as low as 144 Âµm can be obtained by high-speed laser cladding of thin-sheet substrates. Thus, pathways toward thin-sheet substrates with enhanced performance are opened. Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.',

        abstract:
          'Successful and efficient hybrid manufacturing consisting of Directed Energy Deposition (DED) followed by milling as a postprocess requires that material deposited during the DED step be geometrically consistent and slightly larger than the desired final, machined dimensions. DED clad width is directly correlated to meltpool energy, while powder fluence directly correlated to DED clad cross-sectional area. Due to heat accumulation into the DED part during deposition, meltpool energy does not remain constant without modification of DED process parameters over the deposition cycle. Meltpool energy is typically managed by decreasing the laser power to reduce the energy fluence into the meltpool â though this technique limits DED productivity. If the working distance and laser optics within the deposition head are static, energy fluence reduction can also be achieved by increasing deposition head feedrate. Modifying powder mass flowrate through the deposition nozzle to maintain powder fluence into the meltpool allows for both the clad geometry to be maintained while also increasing the productivity of the DED process. Numerical simulation of the heat flow in a DED thin wall part was used to derive laser energy fluence values to maintain a constant meltpool energy. Derived values were tested using both the laser power and feedrate to moderate energy fluence into the meltpool. Results are compared to a thin wall deposited without meltpool energy control. Clad geometry variation and cycle time are both shown to reduce when using a feedrate-based meltpool energy control method as compared to laser power-based meltpool energy control or no meltpool energy control, increasing the geometric accuracy for postprocess machining and productivity.

        abstract:
          'Additive manufacturing applications in the aeronautic, automotive, and biomedical industries have increased significantly in recent years as a result of design flexibility. In this regard, several methods are available, notably Directed Energy Deposition with laser (DED-L). However, to achieve the optimum parameters for each situation, a high number of experiments is necessary. Numerical simulations are useful in this context, as they are able to predict trends without conducting exhaustive tests. Mathematical models based on geometrical functions, also known as multi-layer multi-bead (MLMB) models, have been recently introduced in this field and they present good results for the surface profile. Also, their implementation is relatively simple. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a model that can provide a good approximation of the geometrical profile of DED beads. The existing models for DED have not been validated for different materials or applied to different build-up strategies, such as alternated overlapping beads. Thus, a new system of equations had to be implemented for the alternate overlapping build-up strategy. When an existing model was used for iron and Inconel 625, it was noted that the bead width and area were not kept constant during the deposition. The powder catchment efficiency was estimated for both materials and in fact, changed depending on bead position. Therefore, the adjustment was required and a correction factor was applied. In addition, for Inconel, the type of function used for the individual beads was not the same as that for the central beads, which also contradicts the initial assumptions. After applying the new assumptions, errors of 4% for the iron deposits and 10% for the Inconel deposits were obtained. This demonstrates that the proposed mathematical model can be used for the prediction of the deposited layer in additive manufacturing. Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.',

        abstract:
          'Functionally graded materials (FGMs) with site specific chemical composition are commonly manufactured by directed energy deposition (DED). Although previous work fabricated an FGM with a compositional variation between a ferritic and austenitic alloy, difficulties arose due to variations in deposit shape with composition change. This problem also occurs for FGMs in literature; however, unlike other cases, the thermophysical properties of these two alloys were similar throughout the build. Here, we investigate the role of chemical composition and surface-active elements on deposit geometry during the manufacture of FGMs by laser DED. Single-track experiments for the relevant FGM compositions are analyzed with results from a well-tested, three-dimensional, transient numerical heat transfer and fluid flow model and thermodynamic calculations. Experiments showed deposit shape varied as a function of composition for constant laser power and scan speed. Thermodynamic analysis indicated that the oxygen solubility in the fusion zone varied significantly for each composition used for the FGM. Numerical modeling revealed that the change in fluid flow caused by Marangoni convection due to dissolved oxygen in the fusion zone were mainly responsible for the changes in deposit shape observed in experiments. Because oxygen can be introduced into the fusion zone through the feedstock as well as the surrounding atmosphere, these findings elucidate a previously unconsidered aspect of process control during DED fabrication of FGMs. Â© 2020',

        abstract:
          'Laser directed energy deposition (LDED) is one of the metal additive manufacturing processes for fabricating complex shaped metallic components directly from a digital model using high power lasers and metallic powder. To fabricate components with minimum inaccuracies in build geometry and maximum build economy, optimization of process parameters is significant. In the present work, an experimental investigation is carried out to optimize LDED parameters (laser power, scanning speed, powder feed rate, rastering pattern, and build orientation) using an L9 orthogonal array as per the Taguchi design, by building an effective portion of cube geometry. The influence of input process parameters on build geometry and build economy is investigated, and grey relational (GR) analysis is carried out for multiobjective analysis. ANOVA shows that the most significant parameter influencing inaccuracy along the length, inaccuracy along the height, surface unevenness, and edge deviation error is build-orientation, while inaccuracy along the width, build time, and build fraction are largely influenced by laser energy per unit length. GR analysis shows that the build orientation is the most significant parameter. This study is important for considering build geometry and build economy during LDED. Â© 2020 Author(s).',

        abstract:
          'Directed energy deposition (DED) is a metal additive manufacturing process, where dimensional accuracy and repeatability are traditionally challenging to achieve. Strategies for computationally inexpensive process modelling and fast-response process controls of the laser deposition process are necessary to keep the geometric features close to the required dimensional tolerances. The deposition geometry depends highly on the complex local laser-material interaction and global thermal history of the substrate. In order to control the deposition geometry, an accurate and computationally inexpensive discretized state space thermal history model coupled with an analytical deposition geometry model is developed in this work. The model accounts for the local laser-material interaction using the mass and energy equilibrium equations coupled in a lumped parameter solution, as well as the global thermal history of the product using a state space thermomechanical discretization. In literature, studies have only focused on 1D toolpaths with constant process parameters such as speed, powder feedrate, and laser power. As it is possible to achieve highly complex geometric shapes with additive manufacturing, it is important to have models compatible with 2D/3D complex toolpaths. In this paper, an analytical thermomechanical model and a coupled deposition geometry model for DED process are presented and experimentally validated. As such, the thermal history of the deposited part is predicted throughout the process and the geometric features are predicted for 2D toolpaths. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.',

        abstract:
          'Understanding the behaviour of melt pool during laser directed energy deposition (L-DED) is essential for the prediction and control of process quality. Previous effort was focused on the observation of melt pool surface characteristics. In this paper, a coaxial imaging system was employed to determine the melt pool cross sectional geometry and to predict solidified grain orientation during a high deposition rate L-DED process. The image processing procedure, deposition track cross-sectional profile prediction and the relationship between melt pool shape and melt pool dynamics, and grain growth orientation were investigated. Results show that sharp melt pool edges can be obtained so that melt pool width can be predicted with an accuracy of more than 95%. The estimation method of melt pool length has an accuracy of 90%. With the experimental melt pool width and depth data, the cross-sectional profiles of deposited track are predicted at an accuracy of 92% and a good match with experimental data is obtained. The melt pool formation is found to be able to allow the prediction of crystal growth directions during solidification. Â© 2020',

        abstract:
          'This research aims to develop a time-efficient physics-based model for laser directed energy deposition through coaxial powder feeding (LDED-CPF). A clear understanding of the interaction of the laser beam, powder, and substrate and its effects on the temperature field and geometrical characteristics of the melt pool, is of tremendous importance. This research first tries to analytically couple the moving laser beam, the powder stream, and the semi-infinite substrate. A process model is then developed for single-track deposition and experimental validation is conducted by depositing a titanium alloy (Ti-5553) at different laser powers and carrier gas flow rates. Moreover, an alternative method is established to estimate the deposit height based on the melt-pool projection and a process window is developed to consider more physics. Using the developed model, the processing parameters can be efficiently selected and the geometry and temperature field can be predicted for the single-track depositions. Â© 2020',

        abstract:
          'Directed energy deposition (DED) is an additive manufacturing (AM) process where a laser is used to fuse a metal powder onto a substrate. The powder is deposited in a layer-by-layer fashion, and each deposited track is referred to as the clad. Large thermal gradients that occur during DED can cause changes in the clad geometry as well as deformation of the substrate and final part. Thermal behavior of DED manufactured parts and mitigation of thermal distortion has been addressed in the literature, but these studies mainly focused on material properties while neglecting the effect of thermal distortion on part geometry. One of the mitigation strategies that has been widely tested and accepted is substrate preheating. This study uses analytical and experimental models to observe changes in clad geometry when energy input to the part is varied by adjusting process parameters and preheating the substrate. A method to quantify substrate energy, or the amount of heat energy the substrate holds, is found as well as a relationship between the substrate energy and clad geometry. The geometry of the clad can be controlled by controlling the total energy added to the clad. Â© 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.',

        abstract:
          'Directed Energy Deposition (DED) processes are known for producing parts close to their final shape where only a post-process finish machining is required. However, geometrical deviations due to thermal effects may occur during the process, which results in the final geometry not being achieved or in the necessity of oversizing the part in order to compensate the distortion in the subsequent machining. In this article, a 3D scanning methodology of the manufactured part will be used to measure the geometry at different stages of the Laser Metal Deposition (LMD) process. In this way it is possible to assist the manufacturing as well as to make a comparison with the theoretical geometry during the process. This results in a higher probability of manufacturing the part without process failures and obtaining a precise reproduction of the geometry to be manufactured, reducing the subsequent post-processing operations and saving manufacturing time and cost.

        abstract:
          'One of the main current challenges in the field of additive manufacturing and directed energy deposition of metals, is the need for simulation tools to prevent or reduce the need to adopt a trial-and-error approach to find the optimum processing conditions. A valuable help is offered by numerical simulation, although setting-up and validating a reliable model is challenging, due to many issues related to the laser source, the interaction with the feeding metal, the evolution of the material properties and the boundary conditions. Indeed, many attempts have been reported in the literature, although some issues are usually simplified or neglected. Therefore, this paper is aimed at building a comprehensive numerical model for the process of laser-assisted deposition. Namely: the geometry of the deposited metal is investigated in advance and the most effective reference shape is found to feed the simulation as a function of the governing factors for singleand multi-track, multi-layer deposition; then, a non-stationary thermal model is proposed and the underlying hypotheses to simulate the addition of metal are discussed step-by-step. Validation is eventually conducted, based on experimental evidence. Aluminum alloy 2024 is chosen as feeding metal and substrate. Â© 2019 by the authors.',

        abstract:
          'The complex, multi-faceted physics of laser-based additive metals processing tends to demand high-fidelity models and costly simulation tools to provide predictions accurate enough to aid in selecting process parameters. Of particular difficulty is the accurate determination of melt pool shape and size, which are useful for predicting lack-of-fusion, as this typically requires an adequate treatment of thermal and fluid flow. In this article we describe a novel numerical simulation tool which aims to achieve a balance between accuracy and cost. This is accomplished by making simplifying assumptions regarding the behavior of the gas-liquid interface for processes with a moderate energy density, such as Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS). The details of the implementation, which is based on the solver simpleFoam of the well-known software suite OpenFOAM, are given here and the tool is verified and validated for a LENS process involving Ti-6Al-4V. The results indicate that the new tool predicts width and height of a deposited track to engineering accuracy levels. Â© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.',

        abstract:
          "There is a need for the development of lumped-parameter models that can be used for real-time control design and optimization for laser-based additive manufacturing (AM) processes. Our prior work developed a physics-based multivariable model for melt-pool geometry and temperature dynamics in a single-bead deposition for a directed energy deposition process and then validated the model using experimental data from deposition of single-bead Ti-6AL-4V (or InconelÂ®718) tracks on an OptomecÂ® Laser Engineering Net Shaping (LENSâ¢) system. In this paper, we extend such model for melt-pool geometry in a single-bead deposition to a multibead multilayer deposition and then use the extended model on melt-pool height dynamics to predict part height of a three-dimensional build. Specifically, the extended model incorporates temperature history during the build process, which is approximated by super-positioning the temperature fields generated from Rosenthal's solution of point heat sources, with one heat source corresponding to one bead built before. The proposed model for part height prediction is then validated using builds with a variety of shapes, including single-bead thin wall structures, a patch build, and L-shaped structures, all built with Ti-6AL-4V using an OptomecÂ® LENSTM MR-7 system. The model predictions on average part height show reasonable agreement with the measured average part height, with error rate less than 15%. Â© 2017 by ASME.",

          'There has been continuing effort in developing analytical, numerical, and empirical models of laser-based additive manufacturing (AM) processes in the literature. However, advanced physics-based models that can be directly used for feedback control design, i.e., control-oriented models, are severely lacking. In this paper, we develop a physics-based multivariable model for directed energy deposition. One important difference between our model from the existing work lies in a novel parameterization of the material transfer rate in the deposition as a function of the process operating parameters. Such parameterization allows an improved characterization of the steady-state melt-pool geometry compared to the existing lumped-parameter models. Predictions of melt-pool geometry and temperature from our model are validated using experimental data obtained from deposition of Ti-6AL-4V and deposition of InconelÂ® 718 on a laser engineering net shaping (LENS) AM process and finite-element analysis. Then based on this multivariable model, we design a nonlinear multi-input multi-output (MIMO) control, specifically a feedback linearization (FL) control, to track both melt-pool height and temperature reference trajectories using laser power and laser scan speed.

        abstract:
          'There has been continuing effort in developing analytical, numerical and empirical models of laser-based additive manufacturing (AM) processes in the literature. However, advanced physics-based models that can be directly used for feedback control design, i.e., control-oriented models, are severely lacking. In this paper, we develop a reduced-order (in contrast to finite element models) multivariable model for directed energy deposition. One important difference between our model from the existing work lies in a novel parameterization of the material transfer rate in the deposition as a function of the process operating parameter. Such parameterization allows a more accurate characterization of the steady-state melt-pool geometry compared to the existing lumped-parameter analytical models. Predictions of melt-pool geometry and temperature from our model are validated using experimental data obtained from deposition of Ti-6AL-4V on a laser engineering net shaping (LENS) AM process and finite element analysis. Then based on this reduced-order multivariable model, we design a nonlinear multi-input multi-output (MIMO) control, specifically a feedback linearization control, to track both melt-pool height and temperature reference trajectories using laser power and laser scan speed.
